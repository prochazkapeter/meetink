# E-Ink name badge system with remote control
In recent years, electronic paper, as a display technology, has become a compelling choice for low-power devices. This project explores its use for independent, wirelessly rewritable conference screens. Firmware for both the control gateway and the e-paper screen was developed. Gateway acts as Wi-Fi Access Point(AP) and hosts a webserver which purpose is to control the badges. Communication badge-gateway is done via ESP-NOW protocol.

Whole project is described in the PDF.
